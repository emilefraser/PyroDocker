## Start here

- The most solid stack can be found under: [traefik_stack5](./traefik_stack5)

#### Work in progress
- [traefik_stack6](./traefik_stack6) is not stable at the moment

This project is a **monorepo** (or an aggregation of mini-projects). Just navigate the directories! 

## What is this?

The primary goal is to create the **easiest** and **quickest** docker stack available around the **Docker Swarm ecosystem**. I wished I had this when I started (while back when docker-compose was called fig).

I hope the community will use this repo as a base project to demo other stuff like CMS, Log, Monitoring, Volume and Storage, Dbs, Benchmark tools and other cool applications we love to use in Docker.

To accomplish this, we use the power of :

- play-with-docker (#pwg)
- Docker Swarm mode
- Docker stacks
