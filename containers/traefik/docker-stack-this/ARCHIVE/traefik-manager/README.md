## What is this?
[Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/) is a powerful layer 7 reverse-proxy. Once running, the proxy will give you access to 8 different webapps. I think this is a solid use-case to understand how to run this reverse-proxy.

## General consideration
One of my goal here is to create the quickest demo available around the Docker ecosystem.

To accomplish this, we put together the power of:

- **play-with-docker** (#pwg)
- **docker stacks**
- **docker Swarm mode**

I hope the community will use this repo as a base project to demo other stuff like CMS, Log, Monitoring, storage, benchmark and other cool applications we love to use in Docker. At the very moment, Iâ€™m trying to see if the [tink stack](https://github.com/influxdata/TICK-docker/issues/20) can work for my needs.

## Project source

Original post on my blog > http://pascalandy.com/blog/traefik-demo-docker-stack-and-play-with-docker/ and the [Github repo](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this).

## Something looks weird? Please let me know
I consider this README crystal clear. If there is anything that I could improve, please let me know via an issue.

## Traefik version 
Find it [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/blob/master/traefik-manager/toolproxy.yml#L12)

## Ready. Go!
1. Go to http://labs.play-with-docker.com/ 
2. Create **1 instance** and wait for for the node to provision
3. On **node1**, copy-paste:

```
# Create Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0

# List nodes
docker node ls

# Install common apps
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add nano curl bash git wget unzip ca-certificates

# Clone repo
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this.git
cd docker-stack-this/traefik-manager

# If you prefer to use a branch...
git checkout 1.07; sleep 1;

# Needed to mount the volume
mkdir -p /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/
touch /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/acme.json
chmod 600 /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/acme.json

# Launch all services
./_up
```

## Confirm Traefik is working
1. `docker service ls` is refreshing automatically for about 12 sec.

2. After a while (about 20 sec) we see the logs from Traefik. Do `CTRL-C` and return to terminalâ€™s prompt.

3. Click on `8080` to see **Traefik dashboard**. We see all the services that run behind traefik.

4. Click on `80` and at the end of the URL generate by play-with-ghost, add `/who1` or `/who2` or `/who3`. 

```
# home, the IP is probably different in you #pwg session
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who1
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who2
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who3
```

#### Web apps details:
- **who1** = [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/r/abiosoft/caddy/)
- **who2** = [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)
- **who3** = [whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/emilevauge/whoami/) by Ã‰mile Vauge

#### Why it there an error 404 when I click on 80

For this demo it's normal. It's because there is no real domain that points to the address generated by play-with-ghost. Look at the flag host `- "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:mydummysite.com"` in toolweb.yml

In production you need to point your domain name to the IP of your host.

## Commands
Just execute:

- `./_up`
- `./_down`
- `./_restart` (typical flow when I debug)

This is all I got! Hope you enjoyed this!

## DEV vs PROD
This is **NOT prod ready**

I use my own custom `traefik-private.toml` (that I keep outside of this repo) and overide `traefik.toml` file just after I cloned the repo. You could go fancy and do some sed' stuff as well.

## Final word
Looking to **kickstart you website** (static page page + a CMS) ? Take a look at [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) (another project I shared). It allows you to see and edit websites made with Ghost. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

#### P.S.
If you have solid skills ðŸ¤“ with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang and yoâ€™re looking to help a startup to launch a solid project, I would love to get to know you. Buzz me ðŸ‘‹ on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can see the things that are done and the things we have to do [here](http://firepress.org/blog/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/).

Iâ€™m looking for bright and caring people to join this [journey](http://firepress.org/blog/tag/from-the-heart/) with me.
