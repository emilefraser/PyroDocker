        <p>Once you request a certificate from this PKI (Private Key Infrastructure) you are bound to this agreement.</p>
        <p>Each of your certificates will be valid for the validity period indicated in such certificate unless revoked
        earlier. This agreement will remain in force during the entire period during which any of your certificates are
        valid, continuously so as to include any renewal periods (including automatic renewals). Once you no longer
        possess any valid certificate from this PKI, this agreement will terminate.</p>

        By requesting, accepting, or using a certificate from this PKI you warrant to this PKI and the public-at-large that:
        <ul>
            <li>you are the duly authorized agent of the legitimate registrant of the domain name that is, or is going to
                be, the subject of your certificate;</li>
            <li>all information in your certificate regarding you or your domain name is accurate, current, reliable,
                complete, and not misleading;</li>
            <li>your certificate is only used inside [PKI_COMPANY_NAME] and according to any and all policies of
                [PKI_COMPANY_NAME];</li>
            <li>your certificate is not used in any way to deceive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The contents of your certificates will be based on the information you or your ACME client software sends to this
        PKI. You will immediately inspect the contents of your certificate and by using the certificate you will have
        accepted it and all its contents.</p>
        <p>You warrant and agree that you will install your certificate only on servers that are accessible at the
        subjectAltName(s) listed in it, and that you will use your certificate solely in compliance with all applicable
        laws, regulations, policies and guidelines and solely in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
        <p>The purpose of your certificate is to authenticate and encrypt intranet communications and you agree that you
        will not use it for any purpose requiring fail-safe performance.</p>
        <p>You warrant and agree that you will immediately request that your certificate be revoked if there is any actual
        or suspected misuse or key compromise, or if any information in your certificate is, or becomes, misleading,
        incorrect or inaccurate. You may make a revocation request to this PKI using ACME client software. You should also
        notify anyone who may have relied upon your use of your certificate that your encrypted communications may have
        been subject to compromise.</p>
        <p>You warrant and agree that you will promptly cease using your certificate if any information in it is, or
        becomes, misleading, incorrect or inaccurate, or upon its revocation or expiration.</p>

        <p>You understand and accept that the certificates are provided as a free-of-charge service and on a best-effort
        basis only.</p>
        <p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS LabCA, THE OPERATOR OF THIS PKI INSTANCE AND ALL THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
        FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES.</p>
