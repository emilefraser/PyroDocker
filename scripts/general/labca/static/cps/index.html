          <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>
            This Certification Practice Statement ("CPS") document outlines the certification services practices for this
            particular instance running the LabCA software. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing,
            validating, revoking, and renewing Certificates. The services are provided for [PKI_COMPANY_NAME] internal use only.
          </p>
          <p>The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CPS:</p>
          <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
            <thead><tr>
              <th>CA Type</th>
              <th>Distinguished Name</th>
              <th>SHA-256 Key Fingerprint</th>
              <th>Validity Period</th>
            </tr></thead>
            <tbody><tr>
              <td>Root CA</td>
              <td>[PKI_ROOT_DN]</td>
              <td>[PKI_ROOT_FINGERPRINT]</td>
              <td>[PKI_ROOT_VALIDITY]</td>
            </tr></tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Certificates issued by this PKI can be used only to establish secure online communication between hosts (as
            identified by the FQDN provided in the Certificate) and clients using the TLS protocol. A Certificate only represents
            that the information contained in it was verified as reasonably correct when the Certificate was issued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certificates may not be used for any application requiring fail-safe performance, providing financial services,
            facilitating interference with encrypted communications or violating laws or regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relying Parties should verify the validity of certificates via CRL or OCSP prior to relying on certificates. CRL and
            OCSP location information is provided within certificates.
          </p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>2. Publication and Repository</strong></p>
          <p>This CPS is published at <a class="public" href="[LABCA_CPS_LOCATION]">[LABCA_CPS_LOCATION]</a></p>
          <p>
            Records of root and intermediate certificates, including those that have been revoked, are available at
            <a class="public" href="[LABCA_CERTS_LOCATION]">[LABCA_CERTS_LOCATION]</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            LabCA certificates contain URLs to locations where certificate-related information is published, including
            revocation information via OCSP and/or CRLs.
          </p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>3. Identification and Authentication</strong></p>
          <p>
            LabCA certificates include a "Subject" field which identifies the subject entity (i.e. organization or domain). The
            subject entity is identified using a distinguished name.
          </p>
          <p>
            LabCA certificates include an "Issuer" field which identifies the issuing entity. The issuing entity is identified
            using a distinguished name.
          </p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>4. Certificate Life-Cycle Operational Requirements</strong></p>
          <p>
            Anyone associated with [PKI_COMPANY_NAME] may submit an application for a certificate via the ACME protocol. Issuance
            will depend on proper validation and compliance with this PKI's policies. End-entity certificates are made available
            to Subscribers via the ACME protocol as soon after issuance as reasonably possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subscribers are obligated to generate Key Pairs using reasonably trustworthy systems and to take reasonable measures
            to protect their Private Keys from unauthorized use or disclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relying Parties must fully evaluate the context in which they are relying on certificates and the information
            contained in them, and decide to what extent the risk of reliance is acceptable. If the risk of relying on a
            certificate is determined to be unacceptable, then Relying Parties should not use the certificate or should obtain
            additional assurances before using the certificate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relying Parties ignoring certificate expiration, revocation data provided via OCSP or CRL, or other pertinent
            information do so at their own risk.
          </p>
          <p>Certificate revocation permanently ends the certificate's operational period prior to its stated validity period.</p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>5. Facilities, Management, and Operational Controls</strong></p>
          <p>Operating this PKI is under full responsibility of [PKI_COMPANY_NAME].</p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>6. Technical Security Controls</strong></p>
          <p>
            LabCA is <strong>not</strong> using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for storing CA private keys. LabCA is intended
            to be used in a lab or intranet environment with sufficient protection against bad actors. It may not be used as
            publicly accessible PKI instance.
          </p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>7. Certificate, CRL, and OCSP Profile</strong></p>
          <p>Any requirements or policies regarding Certificates, CRLs and OCSP are at full discretion of [PKI_COMPANY_NAME].</p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>8. Compliance audit</strong></p>
          <p>Not applicable.</p>

          <p class="caption"><strong>9. Other Business and Legal Matters</strong></p>
          <p>
            LabCA CERTIFICATES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS". LabCA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY TYPE AND DOES
            NOT ACCEPT ANY LIABILITY.
          </p>
          <p>EACH USER AFFIRMATIVELY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO HOLD LabCA RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY.</p>
